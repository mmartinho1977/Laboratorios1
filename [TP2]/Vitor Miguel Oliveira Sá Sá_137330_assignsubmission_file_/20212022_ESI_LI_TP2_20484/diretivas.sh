echo "9/10

Reasonably accurate in showing the hell that is war.
MartinHafer10 - April 2020

I am not particularly a huge fan of war films. Much of it is because they too often glamorize war or present bullet-proof heroes who are anything but realistic. However, I am glad I watched '1917' because neither of these problems exist in the story plus it's a very good depiction of war and the awfulness of it...particularly WWI.

The story is very simple...two lance corporals are sent on a mad dash across enemy territory to alert troops on the other side of this no-man's land that they are walking into a trap. The film shows their journey and the thrilling finale.

The plot is among the simplest I've seen in a war film and the movie is really about action and the men's struggle to sneak across the battlefield and alert their troops....simple. Yet it was made so thoughtfully and realistically that it really worked well. A brilliantly made film...among the best I've seen about war. But it's also very graphic and unpleasant....so be forewarned.

 6/10

Great visuals, but...
Leofwine_draca28 -  December 2020

Sam Mendes' 1917 is, like DUNKIRK before it, a visually impressive but ultimately hollow viewing experience. I mean, I love tracking shots in cinema, but this is just one after another and the effective becomes diluted and underwhelming after a time. The film is at its best when the characters are picking their way through labyrinthine trenches in some stunning visual moments, and there are some CGI-aided set-pieces which are phenomenal too. A great film to look at, then, which brings to life the battlegrounds of WW1 in a way that few films can. A shame that there's virtually no story to go with the visuals. Mendes decided to do the writing himself, which was a mistake, and the characters are dull and paper-thin despite the actors trying their best. There's suspense in the first half, then a great twist, but this proves to be the highlight of the film as things go downhill afterwards. The nadir is the bit where the protagonist forgets his mission to coo at a baby for ten minutes. At this point it's just treading water until the end thankfully comes.

------------------------------------------------------------
 8/10

exceptionally filmed
SnoopyStyle13 - March 2020

Lance Corporals Blake and Schofield are given an urgent message by General Erinmore to deliver to a cut-off unit to stop a planned attack. They travel across abandoned German positions and across German lines facing many dangers.

This is directed by Sam Mendes with cinematography by the great Roger Deakins. It's a faux continuous shot. It's masterfully filmed. The tension is more limited until the action starts. It tries to raise the emotional content after the plane crash. It would work better if Blake starts as the main character. It could have been a great shock. That's what this movie lacks. It doesn't have the bite of great twists and turns other than the great resolution. Nevertheless, this is an exceptionally filmed war action movie and that it is worth every penny.

Stirring War Film
Hitchcoc28 October 2019

The resistant soldier has been a theme for many films over the years. The young man here who serves as a medic has several good reasons for not carrying a gun. Apparently, putting yourself into harms way, unarmed is not adequate to keep you from being tormented. This could have been a cliche, but the acting is superb, the effects amazing, and the pacing works wonderfully. Basing it on an actual Medal of Honor recipient gives it a little push ahead of most others.

------------------------------------------------------------
 10/10

Outstanding and moving
safenoe30 March 2021

Here the cast is mostly Australian, except for Andrew Garfield (Desmond Doss) and Vince Vaughn as the Army Sergeant who starts off as tough-as-nails before showing more humanity. I read that Mel Gibson refused to film any steamy scenes (like that in Basic Instinct or Don't Look Now), so that explains why in the wedding night scene Desmond and his wife (played by Teresa Palmer) just kiss, fully clothed as well.
But all bets are off for the war scenes where no blood and guts are spared.

A computer world Alice in Wonderland. Sci-fi greatness!
michaelRokeefe8 April 2000

A computer cowboy rides into a new realm of reality. Not to learn right from wrong; reality from the surreal. What is it like going too far into the looking glass? This movie sets new standards for science fiction and making movies period. Don't worry about trying to understand what you see. Just buckle up and endure. The special effects and sound are beyond compare.
Keanu Reeves is really good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are equally important to watch. A bucket of popcorn, a Payday and two Pepsi Colas....and nerves of steel. What a flick!!!

Calicodreamin22 April 2020

A great send off of the 90s, the matrix is a one of a kind sci-fi action movie. The cgi and stunts are amazing, the choreography of the fight scenes are crazy good. The acting is great from both the good guys and the bad guys, Keanu is amazing. The outfits are badass and really send this over the edge, who doesn't want to look like Carrie Ann moss?!

Badass
Calicodreamin20 July 2021

A mindless action film that has a great vibe and some bad ass action. Reeves slays (literally) as John Wick. The premise is simple, the characters well cast, and the action amazingly choreographed. The dark cinematography fits this film perfectly.

Never cross John Wick
safenoe23 November 2020

Keanu Reeves (Always Be My Maybe) plays one tough dude, being John Wick, a man who you never, ever cross. Much has been said about this film. Ideally I would like to have seen Russian actors cast as the Russians, but I guess the British actors were suitable substitutes I guess.

The sequels weren't as good, but still, any Wick is better than none that's for sure.

This movie version of Stephen King's It really delivers the scares!
tavm13 September 2017

Well, just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and I'll just now say: This is quite intense! Stephen King sure can pull the scares, right? The guy who played Pennywise the Clown is such a creepy presence throughout the movie. The loser kids who bond over this really did their parts well, didn't they? I especially like the one girl in the group, Beverly. All I'll say now is I and my friend highly recommend It!

Not that scary, but still quite good
cricketbat31 December 2018

It isn't especially frightening, but that doesn't mean It's not a good horror movie. It is. I was impressed by the young cast and by the unsettling visual effects. The story feels a little repetitive, though, and Pennywise didn't cause the dread in the pit of my stomach that I got from Tim Curry's version. Still, I'm looking forward to seeing the second half of this story.

It Was OK. I Guess There's a Sequel
Hitchcoc19 July 2021

This was your garden variety horror film with really ugly monsters who are attracted to just a bit of sound. The folks trying to survive are not that interesting and part of it is they seem totally outdone by the creatures. Of course, when the thing ends the producers must have had a sequel in place beforehand and left us hanging. I never felt the suspense because no dialogue, no information.

Overrated
Calicodreamin28 October 2019

I wanted to watch this because of all the hype, but I think this movie is a bit overrated. The first half is quite boring and a bit over dramatic (they're making nominal noise so why can't they whisper?). The second half is much better, once the action hyped up. But overall I didn't think the characters were well developed, the storyline was dull and lacked flow.
