Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).

Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.

If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. Its a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.

The Shawshank Redemption should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd Redding, who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.

This movie, like Carrie, The Shining, Dolores Claiborne, The Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis, just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but The Shawshank Redemption is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I cant believe that it won no Oscars!" >> Reviews

Up until today, I haven't bothered to review "The Godfather". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching "The Godfather" and "The Godfather: Part II", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.

Heady, scalding adaptation of Mario Puzo's bestselling book about Italian Mafia family as seen through many years time. Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble. Won Oscars for Brando as Best Actor (he refused it), Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adapted screenplay and for Best Picture. Followed by two Coppola-directed sequels in 1974 and 1990." >> Reviews

Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.

Gotham City no longer has an ethereal, poetic glow. In director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to his 2005 blockbuster "Batman Begins", Gotham is just another Metropolitan city full of embittered residents squirming under the stronghold of Mafiosos, psychopaths, blackmailers, and terrorists--namely the Joker, who opens the film robbing a bank owned by the Mob with his masked cohorts, whom he has no loyalty to. Heath Ledger won a posthumous Supporting Actor Oscar for his twisted portrayal of the Joker--playing the facially-scarred criminal mastermind as if he just escaped from a lunatic asylum--but it isn't a multi-layered, pleasurable performance. Christian Bale returns as billionaire Bruce Wayne (and his alter-ego, a flesh-and-blood Batman), putting his trust in Gotham's latest hotshot District Attorney who is dating Wayne's childhood sweetheart and going after the Mafia in court, if the Joker doesn't get to them first. Nolan stages an extended, fiery vehicle chase that is absolutely astounding, yet the rest of his film falls a bit short. The performances are variable, the mood is dour and depressing, and the illogical plot tied in endless, headache-inducing knots. Fans of the Superhero genre will no doubt revel in the sleek look of the picture, but the script (penned by director Nolan and his brother Jonathan) is a disappointment, not helped by the smash-and-grab editing which cuts off and mixes up sequences before the drama has even played out." >> Reviews

Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are guided by Gollum to the darkest of Mordor. Gandalf leads the group to to Isengard where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin having already defeated Saruman. Pippin touches the crystal ball and Sauron mistakenly assumes that he is the ring bearer. Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne.

The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven. Technically it is far superior and the story is a compelling epic.

First of all, let me just say how impressed I was with the first two movies in this trilogy. They were outstanding films and deserving of all the awards they received. Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two. The main reason can be summed up in one word: OVERKILL.

Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one: "King Kong," where the action was way too much, too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers' intelligence. So was this film, the third in the LOTR series.

It was too much action, so much that after halfway through this 3 hour, 20-minute movie I was numb by then and could care less what happened from that point. I stuck with it, but it just got worse and worse with more ridiculous action scenes going on one after the other with absolutely no credibility to any of them.

Examples of what I mean regarding "credibility" are scenes in which humongous monsters and machines 100 times the size and strength of the "good guys" would always lose. Even females and little Hobbitts disposed of these-supposedly indestructible creatures, time after time. It was so Rambo-like, so stupidly juvenile it was insulting to watch.

After awhile, it wasn't even entertaining....the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie. To use another descriptive word, this film - like Jackson's subsequent King Kong - was EXCESSIVE.

By overdoing the action, the awesome-looking creatures and the wonderful special-effects that captured the LOTR audiences for the first two movies, ended this trilogy on a sour note. Too much violence translates into "boring."

I also got tired of seeing a 99-percent dead "Frodo" somehow still managing to go on and on with these never-ending agonizing looks on his face and his little tearful buddies crying their eyes out constantly. Enough already! Finish the story!

This was overkill of the worst magnitude and an almost needless last three hours of a great story." >> Reviews

echo "

I heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.

My main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.

Inception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.

Overall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox.


Watching Inception with its futuristic emphasis on getting inside people's heads through dreams, especially hearing Leonardo DiCaprio explain the pitfalls to newbie Ellen Page, I couldn't help thinking about Forbidden Planet and that warning about monsters from the Id. Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?

Christopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.

Some problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.

Very nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction.

I truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought." >> Reviews

echo "There are currently almost 2800 reviews on IMDB for this film....and so what I have to say about the movie really isn't all that important. It also is one of the highest rated films ever on IMDB. And, so much has been said about the film, I think I'll be rather brief.

The plot involves a guy who learns that nothing be sees or does is real...and that the world is nothing like anyone thinks. This is because in the dystopian future, machines keep folks in pods and they live out their lives in a phony existence.

The film's story is interesting...and very existential. I like that aspect of it very much. But the film has a weakness for me and I am sure some other folks might feel the same way...there is just too much action. The film is one scene after another after another--with lots of action, violence and CGI...so much that it boggles the mind. For me, that left me rather tired when the film was over. I liked it...but I also didn't want any more and can't see me watching any of the sequels.


The Wachowsky Brothers took many elements, from different cultures, that they liked, put them in a blender and mixed them together. And the Matrix is what came out. A great sci-fi movie, that has many elements from other movies (and a theme we have also seen in horror movies), put well together.

While I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, he does convince here (as he did in Speed). So while he is in action territory, there is always fun to be had with him. Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne have a great supporting roles, although of course it is a more stylish adventure than anything else. And while the movie leaves open quite a few questions you might have, it works for the movie, being only told a minimum amount of plot. The Keanu Reeves character acts as the viewer as he is thrown in an unknown world. Being baffled and stunned by the whole thing, this might be the reason his casting works so good ...

Apart from that, the action is amazing (Yuen Woo-Ping, very well known for his Asian/martial arts choreography's), the set pieces and the dystopia feel of the movie is pretty convincing ..." >> Reviews

echo "In the African savannah King Mufasa, a lion, rules over the Pride Lands. He explains to his son, a young cub named Simba, that one day he will be the king... but before that he has a lot to learn. There are dangers, even for lions. The greatest danger comes from Simba's Uncle Scar; an embittered lion with a Machiavellian streak. Scar wants to rule but to do that he needs to rid himself of Mufasa and Simba... he has plans. One day Scar's plan works; Mufasa is dead and Simba leaves the Pride Lands believing he is to blame for his father's death. He grows up learning to take things easy with new friends Pumbaa and Timon, a warthog and meerkat. Scar now rules the pride with the help of the hyenas. When Simba learns of how bad things have got in the Pride Lands he will have to decide whether to continue the easy life or fight to make things better.

This film is definitely one of Disney's classics; it has a fine story, some great characters and catchy songs. Simba is a decent protagonist even if the plot demands that he isn't too strong early on and Scar is a great villain; as are his trio of hyena acolytes. Given the film's 'U' certificate I was surprised at how dark it is in places; some scenes might disturb younger viewers as characters are often in real danger. The voice cast is very impressive; notably Jeremy Irons, as Scar, James Earl Jones, as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson, as Zazu the hornbill who is Mufasa's majordomo. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all really good. Overall I'd definitely recommend this for all but the youngest children and adults alike.


King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi have a new son Simba. Mufasa's younger brother Scar is jealous of the new heir to the throne to rule the African plains. Scar tricks Simba to go to the elephant graveyard. Simba takes Nala despite Zazu's warnings. They are set upon by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Mufasa rescues them. Scar comes up with a scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba. Scar places Simba in the middle of a wildebeest stampede herded by the hyenas. Scar kills Mufasa while he's rescuing his son. The hyenas chase Simba away. Scar claims the throne with Simba assumed to be dead. Meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa befriends the lost Simba and teach him their motto "hakuna matata".

Simba is an annoying brat. He's my main problem in this movie because he annoys me even as a self-obsessed cub. It is the point of the movie so I do have to overlook it somewhat. I just don't care enough about Simba. Although, I don't know how I would feel about an animated Hamlet. The songs are iconic. The drama is Shakespearian. There is a lot to like about this classic but not necessarily Simba." >> Reviews

echo "According to IMDb, "The Intouchables" set all sorts of box office records--the second most successful French film in history in France as well as the number one film for 2012 in Germany. So, because of this very impressive pedigree I was perhaps expecting a little more. Now this is NOT to say it's a bad film--it's wonderful. It just didn't seem quite THAT wonderful. But it IS well worth seeing.

As for the plot, this movie is a true-life account of a quadriplegic man (François Cluzet) in search of a new aide. However, all the folks who apply for the job seem the same--boring and sterile. On an odd lark, he chooses an unqualified man who doesn't seem interested in the job at all (Omar Sy). And, oddly, they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract.

While the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story, the film is masterful in several ways. The acting (particularly by Sy) is just terrific. But even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself. It takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with class--including some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks I have ever heard. It is a lovely film.


I was surprised by Untouchable. I did not think that a French film about a wealthy quadriplegic and his black working class carer would be a comedy. Instead I thought the film would be bogged down with race, cultural and class issues.

Francois Cluzet who looks a lot like former F1 world champion Nigel Mansell plays Phillipe. A wealthy widowed aristocrat living in a fabulous Parisian mansion paralyzed from the neck down in a paragliding accident. He needs round the clock care and none of them last long.

Philippe meets Driss (Omar Sy) who is of Senegalese origin. He only attends the job interview to get a signature so he can get his unemployment benefits. Despite being a small time criminal, Philippe likes his irreverence and verve and employs him.

Driss is physically strong but he also brings Philippe to life as he drives him around in one of Philippe's fast cars rather than his adapted disabled friendly van. Driss's lack of stuffiness is exactly what Philippe needed.

Untouchable is a feel good buddy comedy of two men from different tracks of life who bond. It is really a simple story based on true facts, although the real life carer was a French Arab. It is an engaging enough film despite its stereotypes. There is a scene where Driss steals a Faberge egg that was given to Phillipe by his late wife.

The film decided to go for the funk feel of Earth, Wind and Fire. It helps that both stars have an easy chemistry together." >> Reviews

The three hour movie rambled hither and yon, with most characters getting enough screen time to be identifiable. Nonetheless, at the forty-five-minute mark, I whispered to my cousin "I've lost track of who's who" and he muttered back "Me too", despite having seen all the earlier movies. Chris Hemsworth as Thor gets the best jokes, there's one major continuity issue that annoyed me in the big final battle, and the visuals abandoned their adherence to comics I could identify -- understandably so, given the great range of sources they used. Still, it was a well-run matter, even if the MCU has gotten too large for a single movie to include everyone.

For those who look forward to the little scene that runs after the credit starts, you'll have time to duck out for a quick bathroom break (almost three hours, as I said), as it takes place at the end of the credits and leads into CAPTAIN MARVEL, schedule for 2019 -- which is supposed to be set in the 1990s.


If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!

This film tells the story of the ensemble of Marcel superheroes uniting to fight against an evil man called Thanos.

It is a joy just to watch the numerous famous faces in the film! The story is good, visuals are fantastic, and there are loads of fighting. It has all the elements of a blockbuster.

However, the plot doesn't drive itself, and is not overly engaging because of the vast number of characters in different locations and subplots. It feels a bit fragmented to be. Still, I enjoyed the film a lot. By the way, the ending surprised me a little, and I guess we have to wait for the resolution of the story in the next Avengers gymf." >> Reviews

The film gets a bit weird in it effort to create over-the-top action. It seems Deckard is former British special ops who is an expert at being a ghost. His own unit is attempting to take him out as well. This becomes "a war between shadows and ghosts" as head spook Kurt Russell claims. Now in order to find Deckard, who always finds them, they must first rescue Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has the ultimate hacking chip called God's Eye whereby they can locate anybody in the world. This way they can track Deckard who is hunting them. The crew goes on a world tour.

The film includes cars parachuting from planes; a cat fight in formal wear (Ronda Rousey): building jumping; bullet proof everything; cars with no airbags; and the destruction of LA. The action was so incredibly impossible it made me laugh along with the cheesy lines. Oh yes. They re-invented the word "cliff hanger."

There was a nice tribute to Paul Walker at the end of the film.


Seeking revenge for his brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) goes after the crew and this time both sides are wanting to gain access to a hacker who contains a bit of hardware that could change the game in regards to tracking people.

Then the series got back on track and with the fifth and sixth films it pretty much was rivaling any action series out there.

The biggest problem I had with this movie, other than the rather unsatisfying ending, is the fact that these human characters were performing things that not even Iron Man or Thor could have done. I know all of the previous films had moments where you had to turn your brain off but I think a lot of the stuff here just crosses the line to the point where you lose connection with the characters because of the downright crazy stunts.

Now, that's not to say the stunts are bad or boring. They're far from that including the scene where the cars fall from a plane and land on a road where cliffs are everywhere the cars go falling. These scenes are certainly well directed, although there's way too much editing going on. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I think it was a tad bit unsatisfying and especially when the final stunt doesn't really stack up to what we've seen in previous movies.

Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriquez, Ludicrous, Tyrese Gibson, Dwayne Johnson and Paul Walker are all good in their roles but by this time there's no question they own the parts. Of course, Walker's death certainly changed how the film probably turned out but there is a nice tribute to him. Statham spends a bit too much time in a car when his specialty is fighting but he still adds a nice touch to the picture as does Kurt Russell in his part.

FURIOUS 7, as I said, doesn't reach the same levels as the previous two movies but if you're a fan of the series then you'll be entertained." >> Reviews
