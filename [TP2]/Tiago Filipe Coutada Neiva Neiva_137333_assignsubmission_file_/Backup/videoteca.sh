 Reviews:(Sleepin_Dragon) 9/10 -I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but its produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.Go and watch it, youll love it.

         (Edvis-1997) 7/10 -It was good. So far, its in my top10 list of 2021 movies. However, I wasnt rly hooked up, jokes seemed to be outdated, some scenes were rushed. I liked visuals but thats it, I expected more from Marvel." > Shang-ChiandtheLegendoftheTenRings.txt

Storyline: When an Interpol-issued Red Notice the highest level warrant to hunt and capture the world's most wanted goes out, the FBI's top profiler John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) is on the case. His global pursuit finds him smack dab in the middle of a daring heist where he's forced to partner with the world's greatest art thief Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) in order to catch the world's most wanted art thief, The Bishop (Gal Gadot). The high-flying adventure that ensues takes the trio around the world, across the dance floor, trapped in a secluded prison, into the jungle and, worst of all for them, constantly into each other's company.

 Reviews:(imseeg) 8/10 - When the jokes are good, you wont hear me complaining!

The good: excellent jokes, excellent timing and great actors performing at their comical best. Tons of action. Lighthearted, fastpaced, riveting story. Great dialogues. This is comedy at it's best.Not any bad? It's completely silly and that is how it is suppose to be. It's a mix of James Bond and Mission Impossible, but then way more SILLIER.I loved it. Entertainment for the entire family. Young and old could love this. A perfect holiday movie blockbuster.

         (JoBloTheMovieCritic) 5/10 - stunning cinematography and some massive star wattage may be enough for some viewers, but unfortunately there is not too much of interest in this big-budget streaming hit." > RedNotice.txt

Year:1977

IMDB RATING: 8.6/10
Director: George Lucas
Writer: George Lucas

Cast:- Mark Hamill   (Luke Skywalker)
     - Harrison Ford (Han Solo)
     - Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia Organa)
     - Peter Cushing (Grand Moff Tarkin)
     - Alec Guinness (Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi)
     - David Prowse (Darth Vader)
     ...
  
Storyline: Luke Skywalker joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a Wookiee and two droids to save the galaxy from the Empire's world-destroying battle station, while also attempting to rescue Princess Leia from the mysterious Darth Vader.

 Reviews:(SnoopyStyle) 10/10 -This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.

The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's (The Hidden Fortress). George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come.

         (Quino1984) 10/10 -Star Wars is a film that started it all. Not only the beginning of a 6 movie saga, but many other things as well. The film takes many things as influence (Shakespeare's Hamlet, Flash Gordon serials, old voodoo stuff, and Stanley Kubrick's 2001) and it turns it into a terrific movie experience. Some scenes are not all there, but they are made up for the extraordiary space fights and great quotes (May the Force be With You). So, all hail to George Lucas for creating a timeless masterpiece such as this and for many other things (by the way though, even though I think this film is well done, Episode 5 is my favorite)." > "Star Wars IV".txt
